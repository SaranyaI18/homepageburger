    <p class="mt-5">Add .navbar-nav-scroll to a .navbar-nav (or other navbar sub-component) to enable vertical scrolling within the toggleable contents <br>of a collapsed navbar. By default, scrolling kicks in at 75vh (or 75% of the viewport height), 
        but you can override that with the local CSS custom property --bs-navbar-height or custom styles.<br> At larger viewports when the navbar is expanded, content will appear as <br>it does in a default navbar.

        Please note that this behavior comes with a potential drawback of overflowâ€”when setting overflow-y: auto <br>(required to scroll the content here), overflow-x is the equivalent of auto, which will crop some horizontal content.
        
        Here s an example <br>navbar using .navbar-nav-scroll with style="--bs-scroll-height: 100px;", with some extra <br>margin utilities for optimum spacing. Navbars can use .navbar-toggler, .navbar-collapse, and .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl}
          classes to determine when their content collapses behind a button. <br>In combination with other utilities, you can easily choose when to show or hide particular elements.

        For navbars that never <br>collapse, add the .navbar-expand class on the navbar. For navbars that always collapse, dont add any .navbar-expand class.
        
        Toggler
        Navbar togglers are left-aligned <br>by default, but should they follow a sibling element like a .navbar-brand, <br>theyll automatically be aligned to the far right. Reversing your markup will reverse the placement of the toggler. Below are examples of different toggle styles.
        
        With no .navbar-brand shown at the smallest breakpoint: <br>When you do this, we recommend including additional JavaScript to move the focus programmatically to the container when it is opened. Otherwise, keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will likely have a hard time 
        finding the newly revealed content - particularly if the container that was opened<br> comes before the toggler in the documents structure. We also recommend making sure that the toggler has the aria-controls attribute, pointing to the id of the content container. In theory, this allows assistive technology 
        users to jump directly<br> from the toggler to the container it controls but support for this is currently quite patchy. Navbars come with built-in support for a handful of sub-components. Choose from the following as needed:

        .navbar-brand for your company, <br>product, or project name.
        .navbar-nav for a full-height and <br>lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).
        .navbar-toggler for use with our collapse<br> plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.
        Flex and spacing utilities<br> for any form controls and actions.
        .navbar-text for adding <br>vertically centered strings of text.
        .collapse.navbar-collapse
        <br> for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.<br>
        Add an optional .navbar-scroll to set a max-height <br>and scroll expanded navbar content.
        Here s an example of all the sub-components included in a<br> responsive light-themed navbar that automatically collapses at the lg (large) breakpoint.</p>
